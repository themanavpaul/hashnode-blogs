👋🏻 Hey there! I'm [**Manav Paul**](https://linktr.ee/themanavpaul), a 24-year-young **spiritual developer** with a newfound fascination for generative AI. This blog is my digital diary, where I'll be documenting my exploration of this exciting field. As a curious learner, I'm diving headfirst into understanding the basics, experimenting with different tools, and sharing my insights along the way.

**Here are the projects I recently worked on in generative AI**:

1. [**AI Article Summarizer**](https://chaturai.netlify.app/)**:** Tired of reading lengthy articles? My AI summarizer can do just that.
    
2. [**AI Twin 24/7**](https://manavpaul.hashnode.dev/my-ai-twin-works-247-even-while-i-sleep)**:** Imagine having a digital clone that works 24/7, even while you sleep. I've built one!

# **Ready to See it in Action?**

Let’s begin with our demonstration of building a Socratic Method web app for sorting algorithms and visualization – all within 5 minutes and without writing a single line of code!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730640337618/0cbbc0db-5bcf-4a01-b3c1-c0f26eb6643c.png align="center")

Also, Created a video tutorial for better understanding : **Full Tutorial**

**Let's Get Started!**

1. **Sign Up and Log In:** Head over to [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/) and create a free account.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730640137500/42a28cf9-ba60-489f-9884-8bdf99f0a1e3.png align="center")
    
2. **Craft Your Prompt:** We'll leverage Bolt's AI assistant, **Gemini**, to write the initial prompt. However, you can always write your own! Here's our prompt:
    

> "Develop a web application to visualize sorting algorithms using the Socratic Method. The app should allow users to select a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) and visualize the sorting process with a bar chart. Offer a Socratic dialogue box to guide users through the algorithm with prompts like 'Why did we swap these elements?'"

3. **Let the Magic Begin:** Copy and paste your prompt into [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/). Watch in awe as Bolt automatically generates the project structure, installs necessary packages, and sets everything up. You can even edit the code, deploy the app, and push it to GitHub – all within the browser!

4. **Project Complete!** Navigate to the "Preview" tab to see your live running application.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730641515176/b49900f9-96c4-4d48-9762-9e9c5021ab12.png align="center")
    
5. **Select Your Algorithm:** Choose the "*Bubble Sort*" option. A code editor box appears below the visualization. Feel free to write your own code or click the "Reset/Swap" button to use the built-in code for the chosen algorithm.**Run the Code!** Click the "Run Code" button. Below the visualization area, you'll see the input data being sorted visually in a bar graph format.

6. **Engaging with the Socratic Dialogue:** Currently, clicking the "I'm not sure" and "Let me explain" buttons within the Socratic dialogue box might display an alert box instead of the intended response. Don't worry, there's a simple fix!

7. **Prompting for Improvement:** In the bottom left corner bot (where you can prompt to also modify code), write a new prompt in plain English:
    
    > "Show hints and explanations by clicking the buttons “I’m not sure” and “Let me explain” below the Socratic dialogue box."
    
8. **Bolt Works Its Magic!** Bolt understands your request and updates the app accordingly. Now, clicking the buttons within the Socratic dialogue box displays the intended hint or explanation.

**Voila !** You have successfully created your own full-fledge web application without writing a single line of code.
