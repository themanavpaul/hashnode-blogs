# 1\. Data Acquisition : Building Foundation

The first and foremost step in the generative AI pipeline is **data acquisition**. This involves collecting a suitable dataset that will serve as the foundation for training your model. The quality and quantity of your data will significantly impact the performance and capabilities of your generative AI model.

### **1.1 Checking for Available Data**

Before embarking on data collection, it's essential to **check for existing datasets** that align with your project's goals. Common data formats include:

* **CSV:** Comma-Separated Values
    
* **TXT:** Plain Text
    
* **PDF:** Portable Document Format
    
* **DOCS:** Microsoft Word Documents
    
* **XLSX:** Microsoft Excel Files
    

### **1.2 Acquiring Data from Other Sources**

If you can't find a suitable dataset readily available, consider these alternative sources:

* **Databases:** Accessing existing databases that contain relevant information.
    
* **Internet:** Searching for publicly available datasets online or through academic repositories.
    
* **APIs:** Fetching data from external APIs that provide access to specific datasets.
    
* **Web Scraping:** Extracting data from websites using automated tools.
    

### **1.3 Creating Your Own Data**

In cases where existing datasets are insufficient or unavailable, you may need to **generate your own data**. This can be achieved through:

* **Manual Creation:** Manually inputting or collecting data based on your specific requirements.
    
* **LLM-Generated Data:** Utilizing large language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate synthetic data.

<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong>Note:</strong> If your dataset is limited in size, <strong>data augmentation</strong> techniques can be employed to increase its diversity and improve model performance.</div>
</div>

### **Data Augmentation Techniques**

Data augmentation involves creating new data samples from existing ones by applying various transformations. Here are some common methods:

1. **Synonym Replacement:** Replacing words with synonyms to create variations of the original text.  
    `Example:`
    
    * `Original sentence: "The book is interesting."`
        
    * `Augmented sentence: "The book is captivating."`
        
2. **Image Transformations:** Applying transformations to images, such as horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, rotation, brightness adjustments, noise addition, and cropping.
    
    `Example:`
    
    * `Original image: A photo of a cat sitting on a couch.`
        
    * `Augmented images: The same photo flipped horizontally, rotated 45 degrees, brightened, with added noise, and cropped.`
        
3. **Bigram Flipping:** Swapping word pairs within a sentence to create new sentence structures.
    
    `Example:`
    
    * `Original sentence: "The cat is sleeping."`
        
    * `Augmented sentence: "Is the cat sleeping?"`
        
4. **Backtranslation:** Translating text into another language and then back into the original language to introduce linguistic variations.
    
    `Example:`
    
    * `Original sentence: "I love to read books."`
        
    * `Augmented sentence: "I enjoy perusing literature." (Translated into Spanish and then back into English)`
        
5. **Adding Additional Data or Noise:** Incorporating additional information or random noise to increase diversity.
    
    `Example:`
    
    * `Original sentence: "The weather is sunny."`
        
    * `Augmented sentence: "The weather is sunny today, and the sky is blue. There are clouds in the distance."`

# 2\. Data Preprocessing : Preparing Your Data for Generative AI

Once you've acquired your dataset, the next crucial step is **data preprocessing**. This involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing your data to make it suitable for training your generative AI model. Effective data preprocessing can significantly improve the quality and accuracy of your model's output.

</div>

### **2.1 Cleaning Up Your Data**

* **Remove HTML tags:** If your data contains HTML elements, remove them to ensure clean text.
    
* **Remove emojis:** Emojis can introduce noise into your data, so it's often beneficial to remove them.
    
* ```python
                        import emoji
                        text = emoji.emojize("Python is fun :red_heart:")
                        print(text)
    ```
    
    `Python is fun ‚ù§`
    
* ```python
                        Text = text.encode("utf-8")
                        print(Text)
    ```
    
    `b'Python is fun \xe2\x9d\xa4'`
    
* **Perform spell check and correction:** Correct any spelling errors or typos to improve data accuracy.
    

### **2.2 Basic Preprocessing**

#### **2.2.1 Tokenization**

* **Sentence tokenization:** Break the text into individual sentences.
    
* **Word tokenization:** Break each sentence into individual words.
    
    ***Example:***
    
* **Sentence tokenization:** "My name is Manav. I am a developer."
    
    * `["My name is Manav.", "I am a developer."]`
        
* **Word tokenization:** "My name is Manav."
    
    * `["my", "name", "is", "Manav"]`
        

#### **2.2.2 Optional Preprocessing**

* **Stop word removal:** Remove common words that don't carry significant meaning (e.g., "the," "and," "a").
    
* **Stemming:** Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "played" becomes "play").
    
* **Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their dictionary form (e.g., "better" becomes "good").
    

| ***Stemming*** | ***Lemmatization*** |
| --- | --- |
| Process that stems or removes last few characters from a word, often leading to incorrect meanings and spelling. | Considers the context and converts the word to its meaningful base form, which is called Lemma. |
| stemming the word ‚Äò**Caring**‚Äò would return ‚Äò**Car**‚Äò or ‚Äò**Running‚Äô** to ‚Äò**Run‚Äô.** | lemmatizing the word ‚Äò**Caring**‚Äò would return ‚Äò**Care**‚Äò. |
| Stemming is used in case of large dataset where performance is an issue. | Lemmatization is computationally expensive since it involves look-up tables and what not. |
| Faster, but may create unrecognizable words and lose meaning. This is known as ‚Äúover stemming.‚Äù | More accurate, preserves meaning and grammatical function, but slower. |

* **Punctuation removal:** Remove punctuation marks (e.g., commas, periods, exclamation points).
    
* **Lowercasing:** Convert all text to lowercase to standardize the data.
    
* **Language detection:** Identify the language of the text to ensure appropriate preprocessing techniques are applied.
    

### **2.3 Advanced Preprocessing (Optional)**

* **Parts of speech tagging:** Assign grammatical tags to each word (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).  
    **Implementation of Parts-of-Speech tagging using Spacy in Python**
    
* ```python
                        # Installing Packages
                        !pip install spacy
                        !python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```
    
* ```python
                        #importing libraries 
                        import spacy
                        
                        # Load the English language model
                        nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
                        
                        # Sample text
                        text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
                        
                        # Process the text with SpaCy
                        doc = nlp(text)
                        
                        # Display the PoS tagged result
                        print("Original Text: ", text)
                        print("PoS Tagging Result:")
                        for token in doc:
                        	print(f"{token.text}: {token.pos_}")
                        
                        # Ouptut for the Code
                        Original Text : The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
                        POS Tagging Result:
                        The : determiner (DT)
                        quick : adjective (JJ)
                        brown : adjective (JJ)
                        fox : noun (NN)
                        jumps : verb (VBZ)
                        over : preposition (IN)
                        the : determiner (DT)
                        lazy : adjective (JJ)
                        dog : noun (NN)
                        . : punctuation (PUNCT)
    ```
    
* **Parsing Tree:** Analyze the syntactic structure of the text to understand relationships between words.

* **Coreference resolution:** Identify entities that refer to the same object (e.g., *Manav is a Yoga Instructor and he loves to do yoga everyday.* "**Manav**" and "**he**").
