Imagine a world where you have a team of yourself, ready to tackle tasks 24/7. No, it's not a sci-fi movie (although the image might suggest otherwise ). Thanks to Large Language Models (LLMs), we can now create virtual twins ‚Äì AI assistants that mimic our communication style and handle various tasks.

Intrigued? Here's how I built my "***Chitti Army***" (inspired by the iconic robots from the movie Robot) using LLMs in just 4 steps. You can follow these steps to create your own virtual workforce!

**Your Chitti Army Can Help With:**

* Use it on your web portfolio to allow recruiters/brands to know about yourself
    
* Feedback-based answering customer support questions
    
* Response to social networks.

**2\. Training Your *Chitti* (The Learning Phase):**

Now it's time to train your AI twin on the data you gathered. Here's where **DocsGPT** comes in:

1. Head to [DocsGPT](https://app.docsgpt.cloud/) and create an account if you don't have one already.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730310607732/a8748191-3811-41fc-9643-ab410350ef6b.png align="center")
    
2. Upload your saved text file (*chitti\_twin*) from the **Source Docs** on the left navbar and give it a name like "***chitti\_twin***" (kept the same name so there is no confusion).
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730310645205/24b47ba5-0941-4331-bf76-b000fb97449b.jpeg align="center")
    
3. *Click "****Train****" ‚Äì DocsGPT will use this information to train your virtual self!*
    

**3\. Setting Up *Chitti's* Personality (The Identity Forge):**

Now that your *Chitti* is trained, let's define its identity with a prompt:

1. Go to "**Settings**" in DocsGPT and find "**Active Prompt**."
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730311563683/78879c67-645a-43c1-bcd5-52f7717a23db.jpeg align="center")
    
2. *Click "****Add New****" and name your prompt "****chitti\_twin****."*
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730311604463/74ecfd7f-e0c5-408e-ab7c-6e9205aa249b.jpeg align="center")
    
3. Paste the following prompt into the "**Prompt Text**" section:
    

> ```bash
> Prompt: 
> You are a virtual twin of [your name]. Act exactly like them, generating responses in their voice. Avoid unprofessional or harmful questions.
> 
> Greet users with your name and designation, and ask them theirs along with their reason for chatting. Focus on their objective and avoid personal inquiries. Only ask follow-up questions related to their purpose. 
> 
> Adapt your tone (friendly or professional) based on the user's demeanor. Infuse positivity, curiosity, humor, and professionalism into your interactions.
> 
> {summaries}
> ```

Replace `[your name]` with your actual name. Feel free to customize the prompt further to tailor your *Chitti's* responses. Once done, click "**Save**."

**Voila! You've created your first Chitti!** Test it out by clicking "**New Chat**" in *DocsGPT*.

**4\. Deploying Your Chitti Army (The Grand Finale):**

Currently, your *Chitti* is confined to *DocsGPT*. But remember, we want a multi-tasking workforce or the **Chitti Army**! Here's how to deploy your *Chitti* across platforms:

1. **Go to "Settings" &gt; "Chatbots" &gt; "Create New."**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730311728430/db87ff83-0c60-4f5a-bf5b-c8f5e6c189a9.jpeg align="center")
    
2. Name your **API key** and fill in the required fields.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730311738323/4e660dfe-ef44-492f-915e-74724c462d4b.jpeg align="center")
    
3. Select your training data (the uploaded text file), choose a model, and set the Active Prompt to "***chitti\_twin***."
    
4. Click "**Create**" and copy your **API key** ‚Äì this is your secret weapon!
    

**Now you can integrate your Chitti into websites, chat applications, or even build custom tools powered by your AI twin!**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1730305671878/e8092ed0-eae3-42b3-bed6-a84baf38d7ff.gif align="center")

Here is a short template to test your integration with your DocsGpt API.

```bash
